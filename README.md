This repository demonstrates a common type-related error that can occur in Swift when calling functions with mismatched parameter types. The `bug.swift` file shows the code that produces the error, while `bugSolution.swift` provides a corrected version. The core issue lies in passing a Double value to a function expecting an Int without explicit type casting.  The solution showcases proper type handling and provides a more robust approach to function arguments.
